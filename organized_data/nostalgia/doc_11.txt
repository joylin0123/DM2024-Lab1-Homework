this song came out my senior year in high school-1966 in Texas...my girlfriend and I loved it but with a foreboding knowledge that I might not make it back to marry her..inducted into USMC as a driver/gunner of an APC-just 18 years old-took a RPG was laid up in Hawaii for months but able to walk down the aisle for our wedding in June '67 - 47 years later still married to Dianne ... we both cry like babies when we hear it
