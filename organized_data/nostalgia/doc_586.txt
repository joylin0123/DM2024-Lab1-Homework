My mother sang this to me when I was little tyke, as Jimmy was my nickname. My brother, nicknamed Billy, got the much happier "Billy Boy" as his lullaby, and I always felt a little sad that he got such an upbeat song while I got one that was so sad.Nonetheless, thanks for sharing this. It had been far too long since I'd heard this. :)
