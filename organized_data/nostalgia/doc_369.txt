This was the song played when I was in high school during our junior-senior prom.i remember my dad lend his hand to me saying that can I danced with my daughter .that was the best thing happened to me that night...that was my first and last dance with my dad.because I can't even hold his hands,hug him tight.saying him how much I love him so much because he's already gone.but his memories always remained in my heart.i miss you and I love you so much Papa.
