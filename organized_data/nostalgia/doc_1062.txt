I remember when I first heard this wonderful song. I was riding in the back seat of my father's 1956 DeSoto. I remember the song coming on and how it grabbed my attention. I can honestly say this is the first song I truly liked in my childhood. I had to be about 4 or 5. Now, nearly half a century later, everytime I hear it, I am back in the old DeSoto with a big smile on my face. Thank you Karen. You left us too soon. There has never been a voice as beautiful and rich as yours.
