When I was a kid, my mom played this song to me and she said loves it, but she actually doesn't understand English (we are Chinese). Till now I still remember this song, it brings so many memories back when I listen to it. When we are all weeping for ugly humanity that different countries and races fight against each other, I'm still happy to see that there's always something which brings us together
