My Mum went to see him every time he came to the UK. She said you could hear a pin drop when he sang, such was the appreciation.  She was lucky enough to have front row seats a few times.  My Father passed away in November 1988, and Roy passed a few weeks after.  She has not been able to play his music since unfortunatley.    But all I heard growing up was Roy, thank you Mum
