This will always be one of my all time favorite songs.  I remember playing this and "hello Walls" on 45s at my Grandmom's house over and over and over - until one day she said, "Honey, why don't you just take them home" . my heart was bursting I was so happy!  I have the 45s to this day.    She gave me my love of country music as a little girl .
