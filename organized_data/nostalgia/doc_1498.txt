I was born in 1954 and started to be aware of popular music through my grandmother. This sound, even at the age of 4 or 5 years of age, captured my imagination. I still love it today and, as many others who have commented, there has never been anyone to emulate Elvis in his presentation, voice and presence. He really was gifted.
