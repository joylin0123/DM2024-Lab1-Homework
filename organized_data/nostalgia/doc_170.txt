My first love was a girl called Laura, a young 14 year old me but i never plucked up the courage to ask her out, we was best of friends for a long time during the early 90s but went our separate ways. 20 years later i found her on Facebook, got in contact, messages got flowing, we met up and 4 years later we married, had kids and living happily ever after. Joking, the first part was true, the later part is bullshit.
