This song will forever remind me of my friend joy. I swear on my life she was as close to karen carpenter's voice if not identical to Karen and this was my favorite song that i liked to hear joy sing when we were doing karaoke and i swear she made me cry each time she did i haven't talked or heard from joy in years the last time i talked to her she said she had cancer and after that we lost touch i hope she beat that cancer and is still singing Karen's songs as beautifully as she .
