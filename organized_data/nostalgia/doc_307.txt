I remember when I have heard Hank first time-in Dec 1979 in a coffee-bar in Barbados.I asked for who is singin`this song-the barmaid wrote his Name on a paper and I bought an LP in a disc store next day-with a very rare label(by ??PICKWICK)-in middle-Europe he was unknown..Thanks for the postings here!
