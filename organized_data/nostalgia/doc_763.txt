It is so refreshing to hear great songs of a long-gone childhood.  The Youth of today don't know the wonderful music they are missing from the 60s 70s and 80s. The high school dances with no bouncers or police.  The summer night rock in the park parties.  There were no drugs.  Just love and tenderness with your favourite girl.  We respected each other  and ourselves.  We didn't spend money we didn't have. We didn't mutilate our bodies with tattoos and piercings.
