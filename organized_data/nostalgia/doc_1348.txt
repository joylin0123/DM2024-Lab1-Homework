The BEST song for me in the 60's, high school, endless youth energies and the best era for Rock n Roll. When you're raised in these songs and bands, nothing else matters, awesome experiences. Yes, 2019, most of them are gone but their songs and music are etched in our hearts. Walker Brothers, SCOTT, JOHN, GARY- RIP
