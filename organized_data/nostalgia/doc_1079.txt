used to go to my cousins on the weekends 7 or 8 years old used to drive her nuts can we spin that record again we didnt get records as kids so i had to get my fill when i was at my cousins great memories :) great voice and what a real trip down memory lane as music seems so good at doing bringing up emotions good and not so good... these are good memories of innocence and also so sad as that innocence was soon to be gone.. life hey !! RIP Karen !
