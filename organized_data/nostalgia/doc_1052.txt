It was way back in 1973, I was sailing on a cargo ship along Australian coast, suddenly I heard this song on my communication receiver from some unknown Melbourne Radio Station, I was mesmerized with it's wonderful style of singing and what a beautiful composition!  First thing I did after reaching my destination, headed for a music store and purchased  it's 45 rpm record.
