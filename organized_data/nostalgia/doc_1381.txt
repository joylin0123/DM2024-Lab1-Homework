This is a timeless classic and I have always loved it. Reminds me of those innocent days back in early 66 when I was 9 years old.This was playing on the juke box in the Blind Beggar, Whitechapel when Ronnie Kray shot George Cornell straight through the forehead while he was sat at the bar in March 66 killing him almost outright.
