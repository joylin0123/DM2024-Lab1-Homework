I love this classic old faction songs! It brings my memory back to my childhood 40 years ago in China! Can you image that? In 1970s, China is still conservative country. These songs were band to be broadcasted. But beautiful songs were strong enough to break the iron firm rules and were heard from here and there in streets.  When my childhood was poor not able to afford a Carmen castes player, I already could sing these songs in 1970s. Love these songs!
