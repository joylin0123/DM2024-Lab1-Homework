When I was young did not like Elvis,loved the Beatles after my wife and I broke. I was at work in the guardhouse listening to the radio this song came on I just bawled my eyes out not a good sight when your checking people in and out of the gate,always play this when I am on youtube still get a lump in my throat that was 1990,but we are back together again for good
