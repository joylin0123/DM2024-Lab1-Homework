I have most of Mr. Reeves songs.  Always love his smooth voice, so comforting and sounds like the people I grew up around.  They were so gentle and sweet, but I had to leave my little town to find a job at age 17.  I graduated early.  I never forgot how great it was to grow up with simple people who had no pretensions -- just loving and gentle, like I think Jesus is.
