This is so nostalgic that I remember everything I'm doing when I heard this song since I was 7 years old, it gives me goosebumps and got teary eye sometimes. Those good days where the internet isn't that common.Now, I'm gonna leave this comment and maybe (if I'll still remember) find this comment after 50, 60, 70, or so. If I'll still be alive. Ha ha.
