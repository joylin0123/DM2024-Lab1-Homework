My childhood song. since i was a secondary student i just heard this absolutely great song such a many time, i love it because the melody and her voice make me feel relaxed and blow of some steam after school. Now i still listen this song like a habit.<3 <3 I want to send great apologies because of my grammartical mistakes. It's so bad
