This played at my Grandad's funeral just over a year ago. It was one of his favorites. I'd kept my composure relatively in-check throughout the service, but as soon as this song started I completely and utterly lost it. My Nan is named Mary too, so it really hit home for all of us. Thinking about it now, this song is very melancholy but also very uplifting, which I guess makes it quite peaceful. There couldn't have been a more perfect song choice.
