Really hard song for me to listen to.  I used to sing this with my now deceased mother in the car in 80s.  She knew it was my favorite at the time and used to turn it up and we'd sing it to each other.  She was getting something out of me that I usually didn't give her because I didn't really know what love was at 8.
