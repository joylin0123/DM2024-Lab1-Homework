This song has great memories for me ,I was 25 years old and worked as a fork lift truck driver at a dairy in west london , one of the other truck drivers ran a mobile disco called "sloop john b"  we used to take it in turn to drive him and his equipment to various parties and help him set up and pack away afterwards. How I enjoyed doing this especially as the parties had  lot's of very attractive young ladies in attendance.  These lovely memories will stay with me
