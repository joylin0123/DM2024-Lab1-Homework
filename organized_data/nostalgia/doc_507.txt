I like this song very much, when I was in the beginning of my teenage years their was this young fellow I once knew sang it to me. His name was Walter Basco, Skipper Basco's Older brother. ? Skip (this was his nickname Skip)(my nickname was Ginny, still is but back then I spelt it Ginnie)) and I graduated from 8th grade together along with some other students back in 1950's ? My name then was Virginia Maddox-- now it's Havu, has been for going on 58 happy years.. ? :)
