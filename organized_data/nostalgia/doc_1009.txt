I was a music student in 1973 and dating a French Canadian flautist. She was beautiful, the time was beautiful, free from responsibilities and through the radio came `Yesterday once more`. 46 years on and this song along with others , transports me to a time and place never to be experienced again...........where is my flautist now, she lives in this song, thats where she will always be,my beautiful Carole.
