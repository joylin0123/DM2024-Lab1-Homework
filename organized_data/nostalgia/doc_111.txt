I love this song so much. I can still remember my mum Mary sat curled up on my fathers lap while he sung along to this song. He had the most amazing Welsh Singing voice and the loved they shared was so deep. I miss them both so much but I am glad they are still together. Thank you mum and dad for showing me how to give and receive love. I was very blessed to have you both in my life.
