In 1963 I was 12 years old. Brenda Lee performed at the Greater Gulf State Fair in Mobile, Alabama. I was at that performance and I got to meet her. After that I was so in love with her I couldn't think of anything else and couldn't sleep at night. Every cent of my earnings and allowance went to buy her records and my little Japanese transistor radio with the single earplug stayed on every minute of everyday just in case one of her songs played on the radio.
