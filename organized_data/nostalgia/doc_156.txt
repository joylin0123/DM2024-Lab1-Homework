I remember this growing up, used to hear it on the radio and my mum used to play it, was one of them tunes thats always stuck with me. Later on in life i used to sing it to my daughter when she was growing up as a toddler (obviously changed it to her name which is Leoni) and it used to bring tears to her eyes. She's im her late teens now, i dont even know if she would remember it.
