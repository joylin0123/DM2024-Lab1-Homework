I bought this 45 in 1966 when I was thirteen years old and I played it over and over again on my teenage record player.  It's still perfect, exciting, rousing --- certainly among the very best of the great music of its day.  The Hollies harmonies are soaring.  I never get tired of this song.  The smiles on the faces of the singers are so full of genuine pleasure, it is wonderful to watch them perform it.
