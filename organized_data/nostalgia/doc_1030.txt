I remember my neighbor cathy bringing the singles album over to my house back in 1974 and we had a record player on the living room floor and we all sat around listening to the music. That's when i fell in love with karens voice, every song a masterpiece and her brothers arrangements are second to none.She will always be "The princess of pop music"
