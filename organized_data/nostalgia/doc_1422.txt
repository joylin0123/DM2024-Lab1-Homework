I had forgotten this song even existed until I saw the lovely old lady and her cat serenading her sweet little doggo. I was 4 years old when this song came out in 1980. It gives me such warm, early childhood nostalgia. Brings me right back. Feels like yesterday. That lady was probably about my age, now (40-ish) when this song first came out. In the blink of an eye I'll be her age now, if I'm lucky enough to live that long.
