This song has been embedded in my subconscious since I was little. So, fifty or so years later, I've had three wonderful grandsons, and now in 2015, a granddaughter!  Parts of this song have filtered down into my brain, and yes, my granddaughter is "only NINE days old." This beautiful song comes flooding back to me :)
