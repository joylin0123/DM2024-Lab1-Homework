Sadly Missed my favorite singer of that period  What a guy a voice like silk all the asset's that make a Great Singer Crooner  This was when writers earned their corn writing great words to lovely music      When you consider the microphones were no where near as good as they are today  RIP Dickie what an entertainer you were
