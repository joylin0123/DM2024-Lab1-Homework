Hello Romance and Reflection Just heard this on Golden Years Radio . net and all the 60's music that gets played takes me back to the good old days when I had a rock band called The Presidents. Our recording for Decca in 1965 was lost for 53 years and just released in June 2018 and Golden Years has included it in the play list.  Got the old band back together and made a video so it's me 78 miming to me singing 25 - great fun and who knows we might trend : -)
