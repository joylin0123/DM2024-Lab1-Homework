I was in High School too, listening this music when most kids were listening to the Beatles.  These guys were singing about what I was witnessing.  Not the Beatles.  The Yarbirds were the first protest and anti-establishment soldiers.  The beginnings of the youth revolt against the old guard.  Good memories!  Makes me wanna "burn a doob" if I still did that sort of thing.
