Glad to have the memories of these GREAT songs, 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's. Although I graduated HS in '73, my friends called me Teen Angel for my love of the oldies. Of course I loved the contemporaries of that day as well. But I knew the words to just about every 50's & 60's song thanks to my big sisters.
