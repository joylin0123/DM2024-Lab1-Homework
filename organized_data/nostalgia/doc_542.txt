Billy Eckstein! Billy had a great golden voice and was the best of the best in the early 1950s. When I was a very very young boy my parents took me to see him live in Lido Beach Long Island. He sounded great then. He still sounds great now! I bet if Billy were alive now he'd be on tour with standing room only!
