When I was little this was the BEST song I have ever heard in my entire life. I heard this song at an air show back in 70's. There was a Fighter Pilot flying a brand new jet back then called an F-15 strike eagle, who introduced it to the crowd with this song. We had very large speakers behind the crowd that played this song as he went through his entire flight routine. This was the only time in my entire life that I ever saw one man in one plane actually out perform the Blue Angels
