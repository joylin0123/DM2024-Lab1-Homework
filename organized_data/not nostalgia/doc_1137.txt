i bought a singing doll for my daughter and it has those low quality sound preset where it loops a part of a song. i was curios to find out if it was a real song so i listened carefully to her words and googled it and i got here. beautiful song indeed. btw the doll is for 400 rupees in Karachi, Pakistan. (4 Dollars)
