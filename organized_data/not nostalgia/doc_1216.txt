I'd love for people of my age group to realise that music from the past isn't as historic as fossils and that it's a much more basic and illicit alternative to what they currently listen to. As a 17 I have come to the conclusion that my music taste, compared to others my age, has been bold and at some points non existent. However, pretty much all music I here from the 40s, 50s, and 60s (in my experience) is never as explicit or profane as modern music.
