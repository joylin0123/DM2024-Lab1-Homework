Uhh man, music like this was alive back in the day. I appreciate music like this. The 60s through the 90s I'm talking about grown folks music that magic 95.9 hardly ever play. But when they do get around playing grown folks music they wanna short cut it then play something that don't have no meaning to it like we have to be enthusiastic to enjoy it. Oh God!!
