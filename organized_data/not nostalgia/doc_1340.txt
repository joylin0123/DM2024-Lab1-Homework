Most people aren't aware of this fact, but in 1966 the Walker Brothers popularity in the UK ??it particularly that of lead vocalist Scott ??it reached a new high, especially among teenage girls, and their fan club in that country was said to have been larger than The Beatles. "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore," which hit number 1 in the UK, also did well in the U.S., but was less successful, charting at number 20.
