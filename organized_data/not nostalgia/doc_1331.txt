There's so much great stuff going on musically (like the really cool Spectorish bass line, echoed on piano) that it's easy to miss what a really excellent lyric this song has. "Emptiness...It's a place you're in...nothing to lose...but no more to win..."  Great song.  Did this one start out with the Four Seasons?
