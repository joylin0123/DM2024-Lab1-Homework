This song is so beautiful even though it's only disco. I would have to say it's the most romantic and elaborate disco (after A Fifth of Beethoven and the instrumental-only version of Beegees Saturday Night Fever) Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel fires up my imagination. I see a Princess cruise ship (like the one on Love Boat) out at sea and a lot of happy romantic couples dancing and kissing walking around arm in arm or shoulder on shoulder. So gorgeous.
