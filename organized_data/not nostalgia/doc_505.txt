Dinah Shore  -- and --  Mitch Miller's Sing Alongs were still using some of Les Paul and Mary Ford's original hits into the late 50's and early sixties.  Patti Page's covers were beautiful  and still are ( She will be missed ) today.  Teresa Brewer sang  "Mocking Bird Hill" like a sad,  sleepy lullaby instead of something to wake up to. It was the WRONG interpretation!!!
