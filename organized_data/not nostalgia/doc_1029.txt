Probably the best female voice out there ever? So many hits! When she sang she really put so much emotion into the songs it is as if she personally is feeling those emotions. Some very, well, depressing, but what people go through at times and can relate with I believe. Richard, it is said, never got the credit he deserved for this music. Musicians know the truth I guess. She passed at 32...imagine another 30 years with their duo combination?
