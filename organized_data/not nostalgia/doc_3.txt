30 day leave from 1st tour in Viet Nam to convince my Mary Lou to "marry me" when I came back from my 2nd tour.  Now, 47 years later this December God granted the greatest blessing a man can receive.  This song is for the hope of life all who have served pray for and some are granted that hope to be reality. Thank you my Mary Lou.
