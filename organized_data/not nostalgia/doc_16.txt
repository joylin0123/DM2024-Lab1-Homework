Sir. Jim Reeves!! I love him. I'm 29 years old man from Myanmar. I was presented albums of his songs by Mr. Eric (Australia) of which I guess I could sing along at least 100 songs by now! I heard him he's a boxer as well in his college years! He's no.1 top singer of my grandpa & grandma, my daddy& mummy, and of mine, maybe next to the generation to come :) I love him, he is wonderful!
