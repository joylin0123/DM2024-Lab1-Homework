Great addition to this wonderful song to add the movie stills from the golden age of Hollywood. Do I get extra credit for being able to name well over half the men? I was stumped by a few of the women though, but Sophia and Veronica didn't get past me! It would be nice if someone could list all the stars shown. Offhand, without re-running the video, I can picture Glen Ford, John Wayne, Montgomery Clift, Alan Ladd, James Dean, John Barrymore, Spencer Tracy.
