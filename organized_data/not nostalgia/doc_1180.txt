Anybody else think this song might have been whispering in the minds/memories/ears of The Who when they wrote "I Can See For Miles"?  The beginning of that song seems to parallel the beginning of this one where you think, "Hey, I know I've heard that melody before".  Love both songs but always think of the other when hearing it and vice versa.  The Hollies song came first in 1966 with The Who's following in '67.  Just wondering if anybody else who's always been more familiar .
