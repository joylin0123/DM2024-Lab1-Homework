I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Marin.  I have about 8,000 songs in my iTunes, and this one is my favorite of all.  I can't stand most of the garbage being put out there today, so most of my music is 50's to the 80's, so "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore" is in good company. But it stands alone as the very best.  Funny, but none of the trio that made their music has the surname of Walker.
